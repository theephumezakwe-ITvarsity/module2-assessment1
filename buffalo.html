                   <h3>BUFFALO</h3>
                   <P>The African buffalo is not an ancestor of domestic cattle and is only related to other bovines. Its unpredectable temperement means that the African buffalo has never been domesticated, unlike its Asain counterpart, the water buffalo. African buffaloes have few predectors aside from lion and large crocodiles. As a member of the big five game, the cape buffalo is a sought-after trophy in huntimg.</P>
                   <p>The African buffalo is a very robust species. It shoulder can be renge from 1.0 to 1.7m (3.3 to5.6ft) and its head-and-body lenght can range from 1.7 to 3.4m (5.6 to 11.2ft). The tail can range from 70 to 110cm (28 to 43in) long. Compared with other large bovids, it has a long but stocky body(the body lenght can exceed the wild water buffalo, which is heavier and taller) and short standing height. Savanah-type buffaloes weigh 500to 1000kg (11000 to 22000lb), with males normally large than females, reaching the upper weight range. In comparison,forest-type buffaloes, at 250 to 450kg (600 to 1000lb), are only half that size. Its head is carried low; its top is locates below the backline. The front hooves of the buffalo are wider than the rear, which is associated with the need to support the weight of the front part of the body, which id heavier and more powerful than the back.</p>
                   <p>A characteristic feature of the horns of adult male African buffalo (southern and eastern populations) is that the bases come very close together, forming a shield referred to as a "boss". From the base. the horns diverge downwards, then smoothly curve upwards and outwards and in some cases inwards andor backwards. In large bulls, the distance between the ends of th horns cab reach upwards of one metre (the record being 64.5 inches 164cm). The horns from fully when the animal reaches the age of 5 to 6 years old, but the bosses do not become "hard" until it reaches the age of 8 to 9 years old. In cows, the horns are, on avarage, 10-20% smaller, and they do not have a boss. Forest-type buffalohorns are smaller than those savanna-type buffeloes from Southern and East Africa, usually measuring less thsn 40 centimetres (16in), and are almost never fused.</p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                   <P>You will find the buffeloes at pen S33, right next to the Dam</P>
