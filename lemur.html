                   <h3>LEMUR</h3>
                   <p>Lemurs share resemblance with other primates, but evolve independently from monkeys and apes. Due to Madagascar's highly seasonal climate, lemur evolution has produced a level of species diversity ravaling thatof any other primate group.Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000 years ago, there were  lemurs as large as a male gorilla. Most species have been discover or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used.</p>
                   <P>Lemurs range in weight from the 30-gram(1.1oz) mouse lemur to the 9-kilograms(20lb) indri. Lemurs share many common basal primate traits, such as divergent digits on their hands and feet, and nails instead of claws. However, their brain to-body size ratio is smaller than that of anothropiod primates. As with all strepsirrhine primate, they have a wet nose.Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhoine primates, and communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals. Lemurs have a relatively low basal metabolic rate, and as a result may exhibit dormancy such as hibernation or torpor. </P>
                   <p><strong>WHERE YOU WILL FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                   <P>You will find lemur in the North East side of the zoo</P>
