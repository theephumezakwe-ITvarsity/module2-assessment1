                   <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
                   <p>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, icluding savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is accessible.They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments. Elephants have a fassion-fusion society, in which multiple family  groups come together to socialise. Females(cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with offspring. The groups, which do not iclude bulls, are led by the (usually) oldest cow, known as the matriarch.</p>
                   <P>African elephants are listed as vulnerable and Asian elephants as endangered by the international Union for conservation of Nature(IUCN). One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants includ habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephant are used as working anmals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversiallyput on sisplay in zoos, or explioted for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are higly recognisable and have been featuredin art, folklore,religion, literature, and popular culture.</P>
