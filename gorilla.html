                   <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                   <P>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes thatinhabit the forest of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorrillas (both critically endangered), and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is icluded, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos.</P>
                   <P>Gorillas natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in sub-saharana Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 3,400 meters (7,200 to 14,100ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in central west Africa countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the democratic republic of the congo near its border with Rwanda.</P>
